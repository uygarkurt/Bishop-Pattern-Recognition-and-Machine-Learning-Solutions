These are my solutions to "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop. You can use my solutions and learn from them. 
Even I try to be careful I may do some mistakes. If you spot any please contact me.

### I stopped uploading my solutions because the author doesn't want all solutions to be on internet, since it is a textbook that used in
classes.###
